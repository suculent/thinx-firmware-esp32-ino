[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/656ce88b25864d8b87d5c41848364253)](https://www.codacy.com/app/suculent/thinx-firmware-esp8266-ino?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=suculent/thinx-firmware-esp8266-ino&utm_campaign=badger)

Arduino firmware for THiNX, providing automatic device registration and OTA updates.

* This is a work in progress.
* 100% functionality is not yet guaranteed.

# Requirements

### Arduino C development

- Arduino IDE or Platform.io
- Arduino libraries: THiNXLib 2.0.50 or newer; ArduinoJSON, EAVManager, ESP8266httpUpdate (to be replaced)
- Open this folder using Atom with installed Platform.io or thinx-firmware-esp8266/thinx-firmware-esp8266.ino using Arduino IDE.
- Run prerelease.sh to bake your commit ID into the Thinx.h file.

### Forced Update

â€¢ Not yet implemented, will be possible in future. 

# Usage

1. Create account on the [http://rtm.thinx.cloud/](http://rtm.thinx.cloud/) site
2. Create an API Key
3. Clone [vanilla NodeMCU app repository](https://github.com/suculent/thinx-firmware-esp8266) 
4. Run the bash ./prerelease.sh to create Thinx.h file; you can edit this with your custom information but the file will be overwritten when building on the server
5. You can store Owner ID and API Key in Thinx.h file in case your project is not stored in public repository. Otherwise make sure WiFiManager is enabled in THiNXLib.h to copy-paste those values to Captive Portal later.
6. Build and upload the code to your device.
7. After restart, connect with some device to WiFi AP 'AP-THiNX' with password 'PASSWORD' and enter the API Key / Owner ID.
8. Device will connect to WiFi and register itself. Check your thinx.cloud dashboard for new device.

... Then you can theoretically add own git source, add ssh-keys to access those sources if not public, attach the source to device to dashboard and click the last icon in row to build/update the device. But that's not tested at time of updating this readme.


Note: In case you'll build/upload your project (e.g. the library) using thinx.cloud, API key will be injected automatically and you should not need to set it up anymore.

# Board support

For properly configuring the `.board` file (preset to ESP8266/Wemos D1 Mini) see the [Arduino CLI Docs](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/blob/master/build/shared/manpage.adoc) docs for the `-board package:arch:board[:parameters]` option.

# Security

Because all the traffic from ESP8266 is usually HTTP-only and not all devices can handle SSL, you can install our side-kick project [THiNX-Connect](https://github.com/suculent/thinx-connect). Install this proxy to your home environment and it will encrypt HTTP traffic to HTTPS and will tunnell your device communication directly to thinx.cloud.
